"""INotifee-style event bus for libp2p.

Modules emit typed event objects whenever something happens — a Kad-DHT
lookup completes, a Bitswap block arrives, mDNS discovers a peer, a pubsub
message is published — and any number of listeners can subscribe to be
notified. The Prometheus metrics exporter is one such listener; logging,
tracing and user code can register additional ones.

This mirrors the existing INotifee fan-out in ``libp2p/network/swarm.py``:
every listener is notified of every event, and a failing listener can never
affect the emitter or the other listeners (each listener's exceptions are
isolated and logged).

Design notes
------------
- **Synchronous, non-blocking fan-out.** ``emit`` invokes each listener
  inline on the caller's path (like go-libp2p's ``event.Bus``). Listeners
  must be fast — prometheus counter increments are — and must not perform
  blocking I/O. This keeps protocol hot paths free of queues and backpressure.
- **Thread-safe.** ``register_listener`` / ``remove_listener`` / ``emit``
  may be called from any thread, which matters for discovery modules whose
  zeroconf callbacks run on a non-trio thread.
