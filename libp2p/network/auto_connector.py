Auto-connector implementation for maintaining minimum connections.

known peers when the connection count falls below the low watermark,
matching go-libp2p behavior.

        Record that a connection to a peer closed.

        ``_disconnect_backoff`` seconds, avoiding immediate reconnect loops
        when disconnects trigger auto-connect (Bug 6 fixup).

        Connections that die quickly (``lifespan`` below
