"""Event definitions for the peer discovery modules.

Emitted on the host's event bus whenever a discovery module observes
something: a peer is discovered or lost via mDNS/bootstrap/random-walk,
a bootstrap connect attempt completes, a random walk finishes.

The app-facing ``peerDiscovery`` singleton (``peerDiscovery.py``) is
unaffected — these events are the observability side of the same
occurrences.
